# PizzaJump
COPRE Artefact
This game was done as a project for an unit called Console Programming Resolution. 

It was made in Unity, built to run on the Android platform.

As main inspiration, the idea came from an old game which I used to play back when the era of smartphones was about to begin, called Doodle Jump. 

The main goal of the game is to keep the pizza on the platforms for as long as possible, while being aware of the potential hazards such as: the red bat and the destructive platforms. 

A report of the game is available here:
